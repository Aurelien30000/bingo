# Minecraft Bingo 5.0
***You cannot run this in conjunction with OptiFine at the moment. The card display will be messed up otherwise.
In case you need performance mods, I recommend using Sodium, Lithium and Phosphor.***

Minecraft Bingo is a custom Minecraft map. Essentially, this is an item fetch quest.

You will be presented with a 5x5 grid of Minecraft items (the Bingo card).
This is a gamemode played in survival. This means, you will need to punch a tree in the beginning and get some initial tools.

All this information is also available in the map itself, in greater detail.

### Goals
There are multiple goals to go for, which will be detected by the game.

* **Bingo**: Get all of the 5 items in any of the rows, columns or diagonals
* **Blackout**: Get all 25 items
* **20 No Bingo**: Obtain 20 items without receiving any Bingo
* **Multi-Bingo**: Unlock several rows, columns and/or diagonals with the same item get at once.

### Custom World Settings
There are some custom world settings endabled, which means the world might look differently from what you would expect in a vanilla game.

* **Tiny Biomes**: This makes exploration less of an issue and allows requiring items from different biomes.
* **Increased Dungeon Rate**: The dungeon rate was increased by a factor of 12.5, which makes finding dungeon loot very possible.
* **Caves**: Caves are increased from a 1/7 chance to 1/6 in Bingo. Ocean caves will not be flooded.
* **Mineshafts**: Mineshafts are completely disabled and you will not find any.
* **No -Ites**: Granite, Diorite and Andesite does not generate. The only purpose those rocks would have in Bingo is annoy players and clutter their inventory.


## Expansion Packs
This is very much experimental and subject to many changes. The idea is that you can make and distribute expansion packs, which can be installed on top of the normal Bingo game.

Currently, not much is possible yet. You can add new items using an expansion data pack and register new rooms for the lobby.
